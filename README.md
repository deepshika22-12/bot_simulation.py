# bot_simulation.py
# Bot Movement Simulation

 Description
This Python program simulates a simple robot (bot) moving forward while checking the distance to obstacles repeatedly. The bot uses random values to simulate sensor readings and decides whether to keep moving or stop to avoid collision.

 Features
- Simulates distance measurement using random values (mimicking sensor data).
- Uses loops and functions to organize the simulation.
- Stops the bot if an obstacle is detected within 20 cm.
- Includes comments in the code for better understanding.

 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the program with the command:
(Replace `bot_simulation.py` with the actual filename.)

Learning Outcomes
- Understanding how loops help continuously check and react to the environment.
- Using functions to break down tasks into reusable parts.
- Simulating sensor input using Pythonâ€™s `random` module.
- Adding delays with `time.sleep()` to mimic real-time behavior.
